Steward issue, 2026-10-22 08:54 refill (steward decisions D53 and D95: simplification that keeps behaviour). Goal: agentic-leverage; skills-akaihola is tier 2 in `<steward-vault>/Goals.md`. Estimated 45 min.

This is draft D4 of [the 2026-10-22 t3-start-thread architecture review](../reviews/2026-10-22-t3-start-thread-architecture-review.md#draft-issues), filed as written there; read that draft and the finding it cites before starting. The review's line numbers refer to its baseline; recheck them on current `main`.

The helper is the steward's only route for follow-ups and settling threads, so keep its CLI, output shapes and refusals unchanged. Don't call a live T3 server: fake servers verify this work, and the steward runs a read-only `inspect` against hopeli's T3 after the merge.

## Work

Move the distinct assertions from the `LostReplyServer` and `MessageServer` tests into the existing V2 wire fixture and delete the duplicated classes and setup. Keep failure controls local to their scenarios; no fixture inheritance or general transport simulator. Skip whatever D1's migration already removed.

## Acceptance

- The change lists every migrated assertion; pre- and post-acceptance loss, exact message identity, settings rejection, workspace checks, private records and dry-run behaviour are still covered.
- No live V1 fake remains, and old-record-on-V2 tests still exist; the suite passes with networking disabled.

## Ground rules

- Behaviour stays the same unless the acceptance says otherwise. Write the pinning test first where the draft asks for one.
- Run at most one focused test command at a time, under your launch prompt's memory rule; no full browser suite.
- Keep private paths and host names out of committed docs and code. The check receipt (`*.evidence.json`) is machine evidence and exempt.
- Handoff: a short outcome; details go in this task record.
